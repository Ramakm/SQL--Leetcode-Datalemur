  ## Question: 

This is the same question as problem #6 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you're given a table Twitter tweet data, write a query to obtain a histogram of tweets posted per user in 2022. Output the tweet count per user as the bucket and the number of Twitter users who fall into that bucket.

In other words, group the users by the number of tweets they posted in 2022 and count the number of users in each group.

  ## Question: Sending vs. Opening Snaps [Snapchat SQL Interview Question]
Assume you're given tables with information on Snapchat users, including their ages and time spent sending and opening snaps.

Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps as a percentage of total time spent on these activities grouped by age group. Round the percentage to 2 decimal places in the output.

Notes:

Calculate the following percentages:
* time spent sending / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
* Time spent opening / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
* To avoid integer division in percentages, multiply by 100.0 and not 100.
