Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps as a percentage of total time spent on these activities grouped by age group. Round the percentage to 2 decimal places in the output.

Calculate the following percentages:

* Time spent opening / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
* To avoid integer division in percentages, multiply by 100.0 and not 100.
